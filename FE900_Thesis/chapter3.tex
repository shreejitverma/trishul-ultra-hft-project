\chapter{High-Level Architecture of an FPGA Matching Engine}

An FPGA-based matching engine is not a monolithic entity but rather a system of interconnected, highly-specialized modules working in harmony. Figure \ref{fig:matching_engine_arch} illustrates the high-level architecture, showing the data flow from network ingress to egress.

\section{Description of Key Modules}

The system is composed of several core modules, each designed to perform a specific task with minimal latency.

\begin{description}
    \item[RX Parser (\texttt{rx\_parser})]
    \textit{Responsibility:} Inspects incoming Ethernet packets to extract the UDP payload containing market data. \\
    \textit{Implementation:} A Finite State Machine (FSM) that tracks byte offsets to strip Ethernet (14 bytes), IP (20 bytes), and UDP (8 bytes) headers, streaming only the payload to the downstream decoder.

    \item[ITCH Decoder (\texttt{itch\_decoder})]
    \textit{Responsibility:} Parses the raw binary payload to identify specific market messages (e.g., "Add Order"). \\
    \textit{Logic:} It accumulates streaming data into a buffer and extracts fixed-width fields (Timestamp, Price, Quantity) once a complete message is received, normalizing them into a unified "Tick" format.

    \item[Order Book (\texttt{book2})]
    \textit{Responsibility:} Maintains the "Best Bid and Offer" (BBO) state in hardware registers. \\
    \textit{Implementation:} Optimized for single-cycle updates. It compares incoming ticks against the current BBO registers (`bid\_px0`, `ask\_px0`) and updates them immediately if the new price is more competitive.

    \item[Strategy Engine (\texttt{strat\_decide})]
    \textit{Responsibility:} The decision-making core. It compares the current market BBO against pre-calculated "fair value" thresholds. \\
    \textit{Logic:} Combinatorial logic checks conditions like `(Ask < FairPrice - Threshold)` to trigger a BUY signal instantly when the market moves favorably.

    \item[Order Encoder (\texttt{order\_encode})]
    \textit{Responsibility:} Formats the internal BUY/SELL signal into a valid exchange-compliant binary message (e.g., OUCH). \\
    \textit{Logic:} A simple state machine that constructs a multi-word packet with the required headers, Price, and Quantity fields, ready for transmission.

    \item[TX Bridge (\texttt{tx\_bridge})]
    \textit{Responsibility:} Adapts the encoder's output to the MAC layer's timing requirements, ensuring valid AXI-Stream handshaking before the packet is placed on the wire.
