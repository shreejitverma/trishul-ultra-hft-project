\chapter{FPGA System Methodology and Implementation}

This chapter delineates the methodological approach taken to realize the proposed AI-integrated high-frequency trading system. The central hypothesis—that hardware-accelerated reinforcement learning can improve market-making performance—necessitates a hybrid architecture. This architecture bifurcates the system into two distinct domains: an Ultra-Low-Latency (ULL) Data Path for execution, and a Hybrid Control Plane for model management.

\section{The Ultra-Low-Latency Data Path Implementation}

The data path is architected as a "pure-in-gates" pipeline, ensuring that every operation on the critical path—from the arrival of a packet to the dispatch of an order—occurs deterministically within the FPGA fabric.

\subsection{Network Ingress: Deterministic Parsing}
The ingress pipeline minimizes latency by processing network headers in parallel with data arrival. The \texttt{rx\_parser} module implements a hierarchical Finite State Machine (FSM) that decouples protocol layers.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cycle 0 (Ethernet):} The FSM identifies the Start of Frame (SOF) and consumes the 14-byte Ethernet header.
    \item \textbf{Cycle 1 (IPv4):} Source and Destination IP addresses are extracted. The module validates the IP checksum in real-time.
    \item \textbf{Cycle 2 (UDP):} Port numbers are verified against a programmable whitelist. This early-discard mechanism ensures that only relevant market data enters the processing pipeline.
    \item \textbf{Payload Streaming:} Once validated, the FSM asserts a valid signal, streaming the payload to the decoder. This "cut-through" design allows downstream processing to begin before the entire packet has been buffered.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Feed Handling: Semantic Extraction}
The \texttt{itch\_decoder} transforms the raw byte stream into semantic market events. It employs a 512-bit shift register to accumulate incoming words. Pattern matching logic scans this buffer for specific message type identifiers (e.g., 'A' for Add Order). Upon detection, combinatorial logic extracts the Price and Quantity fields using fixed bit-offsets, normalizing them into a standardized internal format. This removes the variability of the wire protocol from the core logic.

\section{Core Innovation: The RL-Inference Module}

The pivotal contribution of this work is the replacement of static decision logic with the \texttt{strat\_decide.v} module. This hardware core embeds a trained Reinforcement Learning policy directly into the datapath. To meet the stringent timing requirements of a 300 MHz clock domain, the inference engine is structured as a 4-stage pipeline:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Stage 1: Feature Extraction.} The module computes derived market features in real-time. \textit{Features are essentially "summaries" of the market state, like whether the spread is wide or if there are more buyers than sellers.}
    \item \textbf{Stage 2: DSP-Accelerated MAC.} The feature vector is fed into specialized arithmetic units. \textit{MAC stands for "Multiply-Accumulate," which is just a fancy way of saying the system performs thousands of weighted calculations simultaneously to find the best signal.}
    \item \textbf{Stage 3: Hardware Activation.} The output passes through an activation function. \textit{This acts like a filter that ignores weak, unimportant signals and only passes through strong, useful information.}
    \item \textbf{Stage 4: Decision Thresholding.} The activated values are compared against learned thresholds. \textit{This is the final "Go/No-Go" check. If the signal is strong enough, it triggers a discrete BUY or SELL order.}
\end{enumerate}

This pipelined architecture achieves a total inference latency of approximately 13.3 nanoseconds, effectively rendering the AI decision-making cost negligible in the context of the total system latency.

\subsection{Safety Systems: Hardware Risk Gating}
To mitigate the operational risks associated with probabilistic AI models, the outputs of the RL core are gated by a deterministic safety module, \texttt{risk\_gate}. This module enforces hard constraints on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Max Notional Value:} Preventing orders that exceed a predefined dollar amount.
    \item \textbf{Message Rate:} Limiting the frequency of orders to prevent runaway loops such as \textbf{quote stuffing}---a practice where a large number of orders are rapidly entered and then cancelled to create congestion or deceptive market signals.
\end{itemize}
This "Safety Envelope" ensures that even in the event of model hallucination or input anomalies, the system remains within safe operating parameters.

\section{The Hybrid Control Plane}

A fundamental challenge in hardware-based trading is the rigidity of FPGA logic. To address this, we developed a PCIe-based Hybrid Control Plane. This sideband channel allows the software running on the host CPU to interact with the FPGA dynamically.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Parameter Updates:} The RL model weights are not hard-coded in the bitstream. Instead, they are stored in memory-mapped registers accessible via the AXI-Lite interface. This allows the software strategy engine to retrain the model on recent data and "hot-swap" the weights on the FPGA without interrupting the trading session.
    \item \textbf{Telemetry Export:} The FPGA exposes performance counters and high-resolution timestamps via PCIe. This observability is crucial for verifying the tick-to-trade latency and debugging the interaction between the RL model and live market data.
\end{itemize}
